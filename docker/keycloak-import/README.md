# Keycloak realm import (zero-touch)

The file `nebula-commander-realm.json` is imported by Keycloak at startup when using `start-dev --import-realm`. The realm is only created if it does not already exist.

This directory is bind-mounted read-only into the Keycloak container (see `docker-compose-keycloak.yml` and docker/README.md — Keycloak uses the stock upstream image, no custom build). At container startup, the entrypoint script substitutes the placeholders below using environment variables and writes the result into Keycloak's internal import directory, then Keycloak runs with `--import-realm`. Editing `nebula-commander-realm.json` on the host takes effect on the next `docker compose up`/`restart keycloak` — no image rebuild needed.

## Required environment variables (for placeholders)

These must be available to the **Keycloak container** (e.g. via `env.d/keycloak/keycloak` or by passing `env.d/backend` as an extra env file):

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `NEBULA_COMMANDER_PUBLIC_URL` | **Required.** Must be the **backend** base URL (scheme + host + port where `/api/auth/*` is served). Substituted into the realm JSON for Valid Redirect URIs and web origins. Example: if the backend is at `http://192.168.3.200:9090`, set this to `http://192.168.3.200:9090`. It must match the backend’s `NEBULA_COMMANDER_OIDC_REDIRECT_URI` (or derived `public_url`) base, or Keycloak will reject redirects with `invalid_redirect_uri`. |
| `NEBULA_COMMANDER_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` | Client secret for the nebula-commander client. Must match the backend config. |

The Keycloak container runs a startup step that substitutes these variables in the realm JSON (Keycloak does not do this itself). Set them in `env.d/backend`; the Docker Compose Keycloak stack includes that file.

**If login or reauth fails with "Invalid parameter: redirect_url" / "invalid_redirect_uri"**: Keycloak’s Valid Redirect URIs do not match what the backend sends. Ensure `NEBULA_COMMANDER_PUBLIC_URL` in the **Keycloak** env is exactly the backend base URL (e.g. `http://192.168.3.200:9090`). If the realm was already imported with a different URL, either: (1) in Keycloak Admin → Clients → nebula-commander → Valid redirect URIs, add `{BACKEND_BASE}/api/auth/callback` and `{BACKEND_BASE}/api/auth/reauth/callback` (with your backend base URL), or (2) set the correct `NEBULA_COMMANDER_PUBLIC_URL`, remove the realm (or delete the client), restart Keycloak so the realm is re-imported with the new URLs.

**If login fails with "Invalid scopes: openid profile email"**: the imported client only has the custom scope by default. In Keycloak Admin → Clients → nebula-commander → Client scopes, add **openid** (and optionally **profile**, **email**) to "Assigned default client scopes".

## Backend configuration

When using this imported realm, set the backend OIDC issuer to the nebula-commander realm:

```bash
NEBULA_COMMANDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URL=http://keycloak:8080/realms/nebula-commander
```

(Use the host and port that match your setup; replace `keycloak` with your Keycloak host if different.)
