"""
Windows service-mode paths and activation.

Everything the Nebula Commander Windows service (service.py) and its GUI
client (client/windows-app/) need to share lives under
%ProgramData%\\nebula-commander\\ instead of today's per-user
%APPDATA%/%USERPROFILE% locations, so a LocalSystem service and an unelevated
GUI process can both read/write it. The installer creates this folder at
install time with an ACL granting local Users/Authenticated Users modify
rights (see installer/windows/Product.wxs).

Call enable_shared_mode() once, early, before touching anything from
client.config/client.token_store/client.ncclient: it sets the
NEBULA_COMMANDER_CONFIG_DIR environment variable, which client/config.py's
config_dir() and client/token_store.py's Windows token storage both check and
redirect to when present. This means run_poll_loop(), cmd_enroll(), and every
other existing function that goes through config_dir()/token_store need no
changes themselves - they transparently start reading/writing the shared,
machine-wide location once this has been called.

client/config.py and client/token_store.py stay untouched in their default
(no env var set) behavior - the plain cross-platform CLI and Linux/macOS are
unaffected by any of this.
