"""
The client's own version.

Release builds get it stamped in at build time: CI runs client/stamp_version.py, which
writes client/_build_version.py (git-ignored) from the release tag before PyInstaller
freezes the binaries, so the frozen ncclient / Windows service know which release they
are. Nix builds stamp only GIT_COMMIT / SOURCE_DATE (nix/client-package.nix), since a
flake has no release tag. Anything else - running from a checkout, a dev build -
reports DEV_VERSION, and client/updates.py never auto-updates a dev build.
