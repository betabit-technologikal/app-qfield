# Nebula Commander for Windows: native app (WinUI 3)

A windowed, side-tab (Status / Enrollment / Settings) desktop app that
minimizes to the tray on close instead of exiting. It's a native front end
for the `NebulaCommanderService` Windows Service (`client/windows/service.py`)
- it doesn't run the VPN itself. Everything it shows or changes goes through
the service's named-pipe API (`client/windows/pipe_protocol.py`); it never
touches `%ProgramData%\nebula-commander\`, which is
SYSTEM/Administrators-only.

**Running unelevated is view-only.** Changing settings, enrolling,
accepting/rejecting routes or exit nodes, installing/updating Nebula, and
starting/stopping the service all require an elevated administrator - the
service checks the caller on every change, and the service's ACL only lets
non-admins query it. The app shows a "Relaunch as administrator" bar when it
isn't elevated. The manifest stays `asInvoker` so login autostart (HKCU Run
key) keeps working without a UAC prompt at every login.

This is the **only** GUI now (the installer's finish-dialog checkbox launches
it) - an older Python/Tkinter system-tray-only app that used to ship
alongside it has been removed.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) matching the
  `TargetFramework` in `NebulaCommanderApp.csproj` (currently
  `net10.0-windows10.0.26100.0`) - `dotnet --list-sdks` to check what's
  installed.
- Windows 10 1809+ (`TargetPlatformMinVersion` `10.0.17763.0`) or Windows 11,
  x64. The project also declares `x86`/`ARM64` platforms but only x64 has
  been built/tested.
- No separate Windows App SDK runtime install needed - it's referenced as a
  NuGet package (`Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK`) and bundled at publish time (see
  below), not installed system-wide.

## Run from source (development)

From this directory:

```powershell
dotnet build   # or: dotnet run
```

`dotnet run` launches the built exe directly and blocks until the window
closes (including if it's minimized to the tray - closing from the tray's
Exit menu item is what actually ends the process). For faster iteration,
`dotnet build` then run
`bin\Debug\net10.0-windows10.0.26100.0\win-x64\NebulaCommanderApp.exe`
directly.

Unelevated it's view-only (see above); run it elevated to exercise any
change. It talks to the installed `NebulaCommanderService` and refuses to use
the control pipe unless the pipe's server process is that service (checked via
the service's PID), so a dev copy of the service has to be installed/started
as the real service (`python -m client.windows.service install` + `start`).
If the service isn't installed/running yet, the Status page reflects that
rather than failing.

## Build (self-contained single-file publish)

```powershell
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64
```

Output: `bin\Release\net10.0-windows10.0.26100.0\win-x64\publish\NebulaCommanderApp.exe`
- one file (~335 MB - it bundles the full .NET runtime and Windows App SDK
  runtime, so the published exe has no prerequisites to install on the
  target machine). `WindowsAppSDKSelfContained`, `SelfContained`, and
  `PublishSingleFile` are already set in the csproj, so no extra publish
  flags are needed.

Packaging into the installable MSI (alongside `ncclient.exe`/
`ncclient-service.exe`) is handled by
`installer/windows/Product.wxs` - see `installer/windows/README.md`. CI
publishes this exe automatically on a version tag (`build-windows-app` job
in `.github/workflows/build-ncclient-binaries.yml`).

## Notes for anyone touching this project

- **`UseWindowsForms=true` doesn't work here.** `Tray/TrayIcon.cs` needs
  `System.Windows.Forms.NotifyIcon` (WinUI 3 has no first-party tray icon
  API), but setting the standard `<UseWindowsForms>true</UseWindowsForms>`
  MSBuild property pulls in the WindowsDesktop SDK's WPF/WinForms XAML
  markup-compiler targets, which then collide with the WinUI XAML compiler
  over this project's own `.xaml` files (`MC6000: must include
  PresentationCore, PresentationFramework`). The csproj instead uses
  `<FrameworkReference Include="Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App.WindowsForms" />`,
  which gets the `System.Windows.Forms`/`System.Drawing` assemblies without
  that side effect.
- **`PublishSingleFile` requires `EnableMsixTooling=true`**, even though this
  app is unpackaged (`WindowsPackageType=None`, no MSIX produced) - the
  single-file bundler's `resources.pri` generation depends on that tooling
  being enabled. It's not related to actually producing an MSIX package;
  `WindowsPackageType=None` is what controls that.
- **The published single-file exe extracts bundled content (e.g.
  `Assets/AppIcon.ico`) to `%TEMP%\.net\NebulaCommanderApp\<hash>\` at
  runtime**, and `AppContext.BaseDirectory` is redirected there - standard
  .NET single-file behavior, not something this project's code needs to
  account for (relative-path file lookups like `Assets/AppIcon.ico` resolve
  correctly with no special-casing).
- **Never read or write `%ProgramData%\nebula-commander\` from this app.**
  An earlier design shared that folder with all local users, which let any
  user replace the `nebula.exe` the LocalSystem service runs (SYSTEM code
  execution) and read the node's private key. New features need a pipe
  command (`client/windows/pipe_server.py`'s `_COMMANDS`, marked READ or
  MANAGE) plus a `ServiceApi` wrapper here.
- **`PipeClient` must connect with `TokenImpersonationLevel.Identification`.**
  .NET's default (`None`, anonymous) leaves the service unable to tell who's
  calling, so every MANAGE command would be refused.
- **Nebula's firewall `cidr` field is combinable with `local_cidr`** (since
  Nebula 1.9.0) and matches the peer's certificate-verified overlay IP, not
  a spoofable source address - this is what makes `CidrUtil`'s
  client-side-only overlap check meaningful pre-flight validation rather
  than the actual security boundary (that's enforced server-side in
  generated firewall rules - see `docs/unsafe-routes.md`).
