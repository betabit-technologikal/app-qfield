"""
Start/stop/restart/query the ncclient systemd service from the unprivileged
desktop app - via direct D-Bus calls to systemd's own
`org.freedesktop.systemd1.Manager`, not a `systemctl` subprocess. There is
no `systemctl` binary at all inside the Flatpak sandbox, so this works
identically in and out of it (the old design shelled out to `systemctl`
directly, or via `flatpak-spawn --host` inside the sandbox - see this
file's git history for that version). Authorized by the shipped polkit
rule (packaging/deb/service/payload/usr/share/polkit-1/rules.d/
org.nixrtr.nebulacommander.rules), which grants active local members of
sudo/wheel start/stop/restart on exactly the `ncclient.service` unit (anyone
else gets AccessDenied - see is_access_denied below) - polkit
resolves this from the D-Bus caller's real identity regardless of sandbox,
so no Flatpak-specific permission (like the old design's
`--talk-name=org.freedesktop.Flatpak`) is needed here at all.

`conn.send_and_get_reply()` does NOT raise on an error-type D-Bus reply -
verified against a real systemd1/dbus-daemon in this project's Docker
verification setup (only the higher-level jeepney `Proxy` wrapper does
that); every call here checks `reply.header.message_type` explicitly
instead of relying on an exception.
