# ncclient – Nebula Commander device client

**License:** GNU GPLv3 or later. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) in this directory.

A small client that works like [Defined.net's dnclient](https://docs.defined.net/glossary/dnclient) and [dnclientd](https://docs.defined.net/glossary/dnclientd): enroll once with a code from Nebula Commander, then run as a daemon to pull config and certificates and optionally **orchestrate the Nebula process** (start/restart it when config changes).

## Install

From PyPI (recommended):

```bash
pip install nebula-commander
```

This installs the `ncclient` command. Requires Python 3.10+.

From source (e.g. repo clone):

```bash
pip install -r client/requirements.txt
# then run as: python -m client --server URL enroll --code XXX
```

Or install the package in development mode from the `client/` directory: `pip install -e .` to get the `ncclient` command.

## Enroll (one-time)

1. In Nebula Commander, open **Nodes**, find your node, and click **Enroll**.
2. Copy the enrollment code and run on the device:

```bash
ncclient enroll --server https://YOUR_NEBULA_COMMANDER_URL --code XXXXXXXX
```

This saves the device token to your OS credential store (e.g. Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service) and saves the server URL so you can run `ncclient run` without `--server` next time.

**Upgrading from an older version:** If you previously used a token file, you must re-enroll once after upgrading. You can then delete the old token file if it exists (`~/.config/nebula-commander/token` or `/etc/nebula-commander/token`).

## Run (daemon)

Poll for config and certs every 60 seconds, write them to `/etc/nebula` (or another directory), and **run Nebula** (from your PATH) when config changes. If you have already enrolled, you can omit `--server` (the URL is saved at enrollment):

```bash
ncclient run
# or: ncclient run --server https://YOUR_NEBULA_COMMANDER_URL
```

ncclient assumes `nebula` is on your PATH and will start/restart it by default. Options:

- `--output-dir DIR` – where to write `config.yaml`, `ca.crt`, `host.crt` (default: `/etc/nebula` on Linux/macOS, `~/.nebula` on Windows)
- `--interval N` – poll interval in seconds (default: 60)
- **`--nebula PATH`** – path to the `nebula` binary **only if it's not in PATH** (e.g. `--nebula /opt/homebrew/bin/nebula`). Omit this when `nebula` is already on your PATH.
- **`--restart-service NAME`** – instead of running nebula directly, restart this systemd service after config updates (e.g. `nebula`). Use **only one** of `--nebula` or `--restart-service`.
- **`--accept-dns`** – enable split-horizon DNS: fetch DNS config from the server, write `dns-client.json`, and apply it so the Nebula domain is resolved via the network’s DNS (e.g. lighthouse). On Linux the client tries, in order: **systemd-resolved**, **dnsmasq**, **NetworkManager**, **systemd-networkd** (with resolved), then **/etc/resolv.conf**. The resolv.conf fallback is best-effort only (no guaranteed split-horizon). Install systemd-resolved or dnsmasq for proper split-horizon. On Windows it uses NRPT. Run as root (Linux) or Administrator (Windows) to apply.

Example – nebula in a non-standard location:

```bash
ncclient run --server https://nc.example.com --nebula /usr/local/bin/nebula
```

Example – use systemd to run Nebula; ncclient only restarts the service:

```bash
ncclient run --server https://nc.example.com --restart-service nebula
```

When the certificate was **created** via the server (Create certificate in the Nebula Commander UI), the bundle includes `host.key` and no manual copy is needed. For certificates created via **Sign** (betterkeys, client-generated key), the server does not have the key; place your own `host.key` in the same directory as the generated certs.

**Linux:** Creating the Nebula TUN device requires root. Run ncclient as root so the Nebula process can create the interface, e.g. `sudo ncclient run --server https://...` (or use `--output-dir ~/.nebula` and run as root so nebula reads from a dir that has host.key).

## Split-horizon DNS (Linux)

With `--accept-dns`, ncclient applies split-horizon DNS so the Nebula domain (e.g. `*.nebula.example.com`) is resolved by the network’s DNS server while everything else keeps using the host's normal DNS. It detects how the host manages DNS and uses the matching mechanism:

1. **NetworkManager delegating to systemd-resolved**, or **systemd-resolved** on its own (e.g. systemd-networkd servers) – per-link DNS on the Nebula interface via `resolvectl` (`~domain` routing, not a default route).
2. **NetworkManager with its dnsmasq plugin** – a `server=/domain/ip` snippet in `/etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/`. If NetworkManager writes `/etc/resolv.conf` directly (`dns=default`, e.g. Debian) and `dnsmasq` (Debian: `dnsmasq-base`) is installed, ncclient switches NetworkManager to its dnsmasq plugin with a drop-in in `/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/`. Without dnsmasq or systemd-resolved, split-horizon can't work there and ncclient says so.
3. **A standalone dnsmasq service** – snippet under `/etc/dnsmasq.d/`.
4. **/etc/resolv.conf** – append nameserver and search domain (last resort; not true split-horizon; the first nameserver often gets all queries).

When NetworkManager is running, ncclient also marks the Nebula interface unmanaged (`/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/91-nebula-commander-unmanaged.conf`) so NetworkManager never takes over the tun device, and it deletes stale `nebula*` tun profiles older versions left in `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/`. Every poll it checks the DNS is still in effect and re-applies it if a resolver restart or a recreated interface undid it. Everything is removed again when ncclient stops or DNS is turned off.

If nothing works, ncclient reports why and what to install. For proper split-horizon, use a system with systemd-resolved or dnsmasq. Manual apply/remove scripts (for when ncclient itself isn't run with enough privilege to self-apply): `client/contrib/dns-apply-linux.sh` and `client/contrib/dns-apply-windows.ps1`. **Note:** the Linux fallback script only covers the systemd-resolved, dnsmasq, and resolv.conf backends (not NetworkManager) - on those setups, run `ncclient --accept-dns` directly instead.

## Subnet router / exit node

Being picked as a consumer of a subnet route or exit node (the gateway's "Used by"
list, or this node's own "Use Subnet Router"/"Use Exit Node" dropdown in the admin
UI) makes the route *available* to this device - it isn't used automatically. The
same way `--accept-dns` is a separate local opt-in on top of DNS being enabled for
the network, this device has to locally **accept** a route before Nebula actually
uses it. This is cross-platform (Linux and Windows, since both run through the same
`ncclient` core):

```bash
ncclient routes list                              # what's offered vs. accepted
ncclient routes accept 192.168.1.0/24              # add --via IP if offered by multiple gateways
ncclient routes reject 192.168.1.0/24
ncclient routes accept-exit-node --via 10.100.0.30
ncclient routes reject-exit-node
```

Multiple subnet routes can be accepted at once as long as their CIDRs don't
overlap - `accept` rejects a conflicting one with an explanation of which
already-accepted route it clashes with. At most one exit node is accepted at a
time. A change takes effect within one poll cycle, no restart needed.

**On Linux**, when a node is set up as a *gateway* (advertising a subnet or acting
as an exit node itself, not consuming one), `ncclient` also automatically enables
IP forwarding and installs the nftables rules that make forwarding actually work -
no manual host setup needed there either. See
[../docs/unsafe-routes.md](../docs/unsafe-routes.md) for the full picture on both
sides (gateway and consumer), and what to do on Windows/macOS/Docker or a bare
`nebula` install where the gateway-side automation doesn't run.

## Troubleshooting

- **No network device (tun) created / can't ping Nebula IP**  
  On Linux, Nebula needs root to create the TUN interface. Run **`sudo ncclient run --server ...`**.  
  If the certificate was **created** via the server (Create certificate in the UI), the bundle includes `host.key` and no manual copy is needed. If it was created via **Sign** (betterkeys), put your `host.key` in the output dir (e.g. `/etc/nebula`). Nebula will exit or fail without `host.key`.  
  Nebula's errors are printed to the same terminal; look for messages like "failed to get tun device" (permission) or "no such file" (missing host.key).

- **Nebula starts then exits**  
  Check the Nebula error lines ncclient prints. Common causes: missing `host.key` (for Sign flow; Create flow includes it in the bundle), wrong config path, or (Linux) need to run as root.

## Running at startup

### Quick install (Linux)

On Linux you can install the systemd service with one command:

```bash
sudo ncclient install
```

This checks that you have already enrolled (token is stored in the OS credential store). If not, it prints the exact `ncclient enroll --server URL --code XXXXXXXX` command to run first (get the code from the Nebula Commander UI: Nodes → Enroll). Then it prompts for the server URL and optional settings (output directory, poll interval, nebula path, restart-service), writes `/etc/default/ncclient` and `/etc/systemd/system/ncclient.service`, enables the service, and optionally starts it. Use `--no-start` to enable without starting; use `--non-interactive` with `NEBULA_COMMANDER_SERVER` (and optional env vars) set for scripting.

### Manual setup (all platforms)

Run `ncclient run` under systemd (or your init system) so config and certs stay up to date. ncclient runs `nebula` from your PATH by default; use `--restart-service` if you prefer to have systemd run Nebula and ncclient only restart the service. Example configs are in **`examples/`**; see [examples/README-startup.md](examples/README-startup.md) for step-by-step install on macOS and Windows.

## macOS

ncclient works on macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon). Use Python 3.10+ and install with `pip install nebula-commander`.

- **Token** is stored in the OS credential store (Keychain).
- **Default output dir** is `/etc/nebula` (same as Linux). If you run as a normal user, use `--output-dir ~/.nebula` so you don't need sudo to write config/certs.
- **Nebula**: ncclient runs `nebula` from your PATH by default. After `brew install nebula`, you usually don't need `--nebula`. Use `--nebula /opt/homebrew/bin/nebula` (Apple Silicon) or `--nebula /usr/local/bin/nebula` (Intel) only if it's not on PATH. Do not use `--restart-service`; macOS uses launchd, not systemd.
- To run ncclient in the background, use **launchd** (e.g. a LaunchAgent in `~/Library/LaunchAgents` or a LaunchDaemon in `/Library/LaunchDaemons`).

## Windows 11

ncclient works on Windows 11. Use Python 3.10+ and install with `pip install nebula-commander`.

- **Token** is stored under `%USERPROFILE%\.config\nebula-commander\token`.
- **Default output dir** for config and certs is `%USERPROFILE%\.nebula`. Override with `--output-dir` (e.g. `C:\ProgramData\Nebula` if you run as Administrator).
- **Nebula**: ncclient runs `nebula` from your PATH by default. If `nebula.exe` is not on PATH, use `--nebula "C:\Path\To\nebula.exe"`. Do not use `--restart-service`; there is no systemd on Windows.
- Run ncclient in a terminal or install it as a Windows service (e.g. with NSSM or Task Scheduler) so it keeps running.

### Windows GUI app

**Nebula Commander** (`client/windows-app/`, WinUI 3) ships alongside the CLI,
talking to the `NebulaCommanderService` Windows Service over the shared
`%ProgramData%\nebula-commander\` state. A proper windowed app with side tabs
(Status, Enrollment, Settings), minimizes to the tray on close instead of
exiting. The Status page shows live server/service/interface/DNS state, lets
you start/stop/restart the service, view `config.yaml`, and accept/reject
subnet routes and exit nodes interactively. See
**[client/windows-app/README.md](windows-app/README.md)**.

(The older Python/Tkinter system-tray-only app that used to ship alongside it
has been removed - see **[client/windows/README.md](windows/README.md)** for
the `NebulaCommanderService` it still talks to.)
